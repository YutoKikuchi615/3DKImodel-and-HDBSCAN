## Files
| File | Language | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `model3DKI.pde` | Processing (4.3.4) | 3D-KI model simulation & visualization |
| `dataget.pde` | Processing (4.3.4) | Get data for clustering |
| `HDBSCAN.py`  | Python (3.9.6)    | Clustering using HDBSCAN |

## Tested environment
The programs here were tested under the systems below;
* MacOS Sequoia 15.5

## Quick start
### 1. Processing
1. Install **Processing 4** → open `model3DKI.pde` or `dataget.pde`.
2. Press → to run (invariant parameters inside the file).

### 2. Python (HDBSCAN)
The following packages are required to run this code.
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib hdbscan
```
Additionally, you will need a .txt file generated by running `dataget.py`.
Make sure to rename the file so that it matches the filename specified in the code (e.g., FILENAME = '1000vect(1.00,0.30,1).txt').

This script is intended to be run from the terminal.
```bash
python HDBSCAN.py
```
